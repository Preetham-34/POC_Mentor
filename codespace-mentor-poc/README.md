# 🧑‍🏫 Codespace Mentor — Streamlit Proof of Concept

This is a proof-of-concept learning environment where:
- Learners chat with a **mentor agent** (text + voice).
- The mentor serves **micro-lessons** and worked examples.
- Learners solve **code exercises** in an editor.
- A **progress tracker** updates mastery and adapts the next step.
- Responses can be read aloud via **TTS**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/codespace-mentor-poc.git
cd codespace-mentor-poc
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

⚠️ **Note:** The sandbox uses Python `exec` and is NOT secure for untrusted users. Use only in controlled demo environments.
